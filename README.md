# pixlet!
Pixlet is a simple pixel art editor written in c and uses SDL2.

# Building
First, you need to add SDL2 include folder to `include/`, and then
you need to put the `SDL2main.lib`, `SDL2.lib` and `SDL2_image.lib`
in a folder called `libs/` at project's binary generated by cmake.
After that, call `CMake -S . -G "MinGW Makefiles" -B build && cd build && make`.
